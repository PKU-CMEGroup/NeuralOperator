## Some tips:

1. Request a peer review
     - Modify the code
     - Start a new branch `git checkout -b "your-branch-name"`.
       Then you will be in your branch.
     - Modify the code, `commit` and `push` ....... 
       When you first `push`, it might give errors, try
       `git push --set-upstream origin your-branch-name`
     - When you are ready to merge, push the code. 
       Then go to the GitHub webpage, switch to your branch, click **open pull request**. You will create a pull request. Describe your change and assign reviewers.
     - When reviewers agree with your changes, you can push the code
