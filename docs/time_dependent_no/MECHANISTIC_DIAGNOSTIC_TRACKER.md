# Mechanistic Diagnostic Tracker

Date: 2026-07-04

| Run ID | Milestone | Purpose | System / Variant | Split | Metrics | Priority | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D001 | M0 | Recompute current summaries from rollout arrays | CPGNet one-step bs2 | bump test full | paper RMSE, per-time RMSE, VPT | MUST | DONE | Full 20 trajectories analyzed on AutoDL under `artifacts/time_dependent_no/cpg_mechanistic_diagnostic_20260704_full/`; reproduced user-provided AR summary (`rho=0.200242`, `pres=0.384017`). |
| D002 | M0 | Recompute current summaries from rollout arrays | CPGNet two-stage bs2 | bump test full | paper RMSE, per-time RMSE, VPT | MUST | DONE | Full 20 trajectories analyzed on AutoDL; reproduced user-provided AR summary (`rho=0.158637`, `pres=0.293593`). |
| D003 | M1 | Teacher-forced vs autoregressive error by time | CPGNet one-step and two-stage | bump test full | TF RMSE, AR RMSE, AR/TF ratio | MUST | DONE | Per-time teacher-forced evaluator run on AutoDL. TF remains small over time; AR/TF ratios are ~22-26x for one-step and ~16-28x for two-stage depending on variable. |
| D004 | M1 | State-distribution drift | CPGNet one-step and two-stage | bump test/train stats | z-score drift, range violations | MUST | DONE | Sampled train stats from 30 train trajectories at stride 10. Final predictions almost never leave sampled train min/max ranges except tiny pressure fractions; gross range-OOD drift is not the main explanation. |
| D005 | M1 | Perturbation amplification | CPGNet one-step and two-stage | selected bump test | amplification factor, excess target RMSE | MUST | DONE | Sampled AutoDL probe over 5 trajectories, 4 start frames, two perturbation scales, and 5 channel modes. One-step is mostly locally damped; two-stage is more velocity-sensitive, but induced excess target RMSE is tiny versus full AR errors. |
| D006 | M2 | Shock position and region decomposition | CPGNet one-step and two-stage | bump test full | shock-front IoU/F1, Chamfer/front distance, centroid, near-shock/smooth error, thickness, strength | MUST | DONE | Full q=0.85/0.90/0.95 shock diagnostics run on AutoDL. Shock-local error dominates smooth error, but best-shift alignment explains only a small fraction, so failure is shock-local shape/amplitude/stability plus phase, not pure displacement. |
| D007 | M2 | Rollout animations and overlays | CPGNet one-step and two-stage | selected bump test | qualitative phase/smear/drift labels | MUST | DONE | Generated 32 selected-subset pressure/shock overlay PNGs plus JSON/Markdown gallery under `artifacts/time_dependent_no/cpg_shock_overlay_gallery_20260704/`. |
| D008 | M3 | Equal-node physics diagnostics | CPGNet one-step and two-stage | bump test full | conservation drift, positivity, TV proxy | MUST | DONE | Equal-node normal-node total mismatch, positivity, and clamped-boundary leakage computed for full split. No positivity failures; boundary error is exactly zero under clamped rollout. |
| D009 | M3 | Approximate-weight physics diagnostics | CPGNet one-step and two-stage | bump test | weighted conservation drift | NICE | BLOCKED | Requires mesh/cell weights or a validated geometric approximation; current diagnostics intentionally report equal-node totals only. |
| D010 | M4 | Direct state-predictor control | Direct GNN or simplest available comparable model | bump train/test | B1-B5 metrics | NICE | BLOCKED | Wait for dominant defect |
| D011 | M5 | PCNO diagnostic replay | PCNO completed checkpoint | bump test | B1-B5 metrics | MUST | BLOCKED | Wait for PCNO training artifacts |


## 2026-07-04 Diagnostic Update

Artifacts created under ignored `artifacts/time_dependent_no/`:

| `cpg_mechanistic_diagnostic_20260704_subset/` | First selected-subset diagnostic and key findings. |
| `cpg_mechanistic_diagnostic_20260704_full/` | Full 20-trajectory AR rollout diagnostics for one-step and two-stage CPGNet. |
| `cpg_teacher_forced_per_time_20260704/` | Per-time teacher-forced RMSE for both bs2 checkpoints. |
| `cpg_state_drift_20260704_full/` | Sampled train-stat range/z-score drift diagnostic for full rollouts. |
| `cpg_perturbation_amplification_20260704/` | Controlled perturbation amplification probe for one-step and two-stage CPGNet. |
| `cpg_shock_overlay_gallery_20260704/` | Selected-subset pressure/shock overlay gallery for qualitative phase/shape readout. |
| `cpg_cloud_diagnostics_20260704_summary.md` | Compact interpretation of the full cloud diagnostics. |

Current blockers:

- Approximate/mesh-weighted conservation remains blocked until geometric weights are validated.
- PCNO replay remains blocked until PCNO rollout artifacts match the same output contract.
