# Mechanistic Diagnostic Tracker

Date: 2026-07-04

| Run ID | Milestone | Purpose | System / Variant | Split | Metrics | Priority | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D001 | M0 | Recompute current summaries from rollout arrays | CPGNet one-step bs2 | bump test full | paper RMSE, per-time RMSE, VPT | MUST | DONE | Full 20 trajectories analyzed on AutoDL under `artifacts/time_dependent_no/cpg_mechanistic_diagnostic_20260704_full/`; reproduced user-provided AR summary (`rho=0.200242`, `pres=0.384017`). |
| D002 | M0 | Recompute current summaries from rollout arrays | CPGNet two-stage bs2 | bump test full | paper RMSE, per-time RMSE, VPT | MUST | DONE | Full 20 trajectories analyzed on AutoDL; reproduced user-provided AR summary (`rho=0.158637`, `pres=0.293593`). |
| D003 | M1 | Teacher-forced vs autoregressive error by time | CPGNet one-step and two-stage | bump test full | TF RMSE, AR RMSE, AR/TF ratio | MUST | DONE | Per-time teacher-forced evaluator run on AutoDL. TF remains small over time; AR/TF ratios are ~22-26x for one-step and ~16-28x for two-stage depending on variable. |
| D004 | M1 | State-distribution drift | CPGNet one-step and two-stage | bump test/train stats | z-score drift, range violations | MUST | DONE | Sampled train stats from 30 train trajectories at stride 10. Final predictions almost never leave sampled train min/max ranges except tiny pressure fractions; gross range-OOD drift is not the main explanation. |
| D005 | M1 | Perturbation amplification | CPGNet one-step and two-stage | selected bump test | amplification factor, excess target RMSE | MUST | DONE | Sampled AutoDL probe over 5 trajectories, 4 start frames, two perturbation scales, and 5 channel modes. One-step is mostly locally damped; two-stage is more velocity-sensitive, but induced excess target RMSE is tiny versus full AR errors. |
| D006 | M2 | Shock position and region decomposition | CPGNet one-step and two-stage | bump test full | shock-front IoU/F1, Chamfer/front distance, centroid, near-shock/smooth error, thickness, strength | MUST | DONE | Full q=0.85/0.90/0.95 shock diagnostics run on AutoDL. Shock-local error dominates smooth error, but best-shift alignment explains only a small fraction, so failure is shock-local shape/amplitude/stability plus phase, not pure displacement. |
| D007 | M2 | Rollout animations and overlays | CPGNet one-step and two-stage | selected bump test | qualitative phase/smear/drift labels | MUST | DONE | Generated 32 selected-subset pressure/shock overlay PNGs plus JSON/Markdown gallery under `artifacts/time_dependent_no/cpg_shock_overlay_gallery_20260704/`. |
| D008 | M3 | Equal-node physics diagnostics | CPGNet one-step and two-stage | bump test full | conservation drift, positivity, TV proxy | MUST | DONE | Equal-node normal-node total mismatch, positivity, and clamped-boundary leakage computed for full split. No positivity failures; boundary error is exactly zero under clamped rollout. |
| D009 | M3 | Approximate-weight physics diagnostics | CPGNet one-step and two-stage | bump test | weighted conservation drift | NICE | BLOCKED | Requires mesh/cell weights or a validated geometric approximation; current diagnostics intentionally report equal-node totals only. |
| D010 | M4 | Direct state-predictor control | Direct GNN or simplest available comparable model | bump train/test | B1-B5 metrics | NICE | BLOCKED | Wait for dominant defect |
| D011 | M5 | PCNO diagnostic replay | PCNO completed checkpoint via corrected preprocessing contract | selected bump test | AR RMSE, shock masks, positivity, boundary leakage, animations | MUST | DONE | D019 completed for trajectories 0, 6, 11, 13, 17 using the corrected HDF5-to-npy-to-reconstructed-npz path. The retired raw-HDF5 graph adapter should not be used for model conclusions. |
| D012 | M6 | Correlation-time and geometric rollout aggregation | CPGNet one-step and two-stage | bump test full | high-correlation time, geometric relative error aggregation | MUST | TODO | Add APEBench/PDE-Refiner-style temporal metrics to existing raw-array diagnostic reports. |
| D013 | M6 | Scale/spectral residual diagnostics | CPGNet first, then PCNO | bump test full/subset | edge-jump residual spectra, edge-length bins, graph-mode residuals, region-split spectra | MUST | TODO | Start with graph-native bins; do not use interpolation-to-grid FFT as primary evidence until interpolation error is audited. |
| D014 | M6 | Effective-CFL / receptive-field audit | CPGNet first, then PCNO | bump test full/subset | shock-front motion per step, median-edge-length units, message-passing/hop coverage, correlation with hard trajectories | MUST | TODO | Tests whether hard trajectories exceed stable information-propagation capacity. |
| D015 | M7 | Recurrent/unrolled stabilization control | CPGNet or PCNO after D013/D014 | bump train/test | TF error, AR error, VPT, shock metrics, scale residuals | NICE | BLOCKED | Do not launch until scale/resolution and effective-CFL diagnostics identify which mechanism to target. |
| D016 | M6 | Interface-state latent instrumentation | CPGNet one-step and two-stage bs2 | selected bump test frames | `reconstruct_prims`, one-sided trace metrics, LLF central/dissipation split, induced FV update, wave-type strata | MUST | DONE | Historical probe completed. The one-off implementation was retired from the active tree after the result was recorded; recover from git history only if exact reproduction is needed. |
| D017 | M6 | Interface-state latent selected-frame run | CPGNet one-step and two-stage bs2 | trajectories 0, 6, 11, 13, 17; frames 0, 20, 40, 58, 78 | admissibility, trace-likeness, flux/update match, dissipation localization, speed projection, sampled edge table | MUST | DONE | AutoDL run completed under `artifacts/time_dependent_no/cpg_interface_latent_diagnostic_20260705_full/`; latents are admissible but not physical one-sided traces, induced update matches model delta but not true update exactly, and dissipation is only weakly shock-localized. |
| D018 | M6 | Interface-latent mechanism probe | CPGNet one-step and two-stage bs2 | selected trajectories/frames; teacher-forced and autoregressive state sources | physical projection sensitivity, constrained inverse flux fit, TF-vs-AR latent drift | MUST | DONE | AutoDL run completed under `artifacts/time_dependent_no/cpg_interface_mechanism_probe_20260705_full/`; physical projections do not preserve learned flux/update, constrained physical inverse fits remain poor, and AR mode greatly increases learned-update error against the target next state. |
| D019 | M5 | PCNO corrected preprocessed rollout replay | PCNO Euler checkpoint through collaborator-compatible preprocessing | trajectories 0, 6, 11, 13, 17 | AR RMSE, positivity, velocity blow-up, GIF gallery | MUST | DONE | AutoDL selected replay completed under ignored corrected PCNO rollout artifacts. Visual readout: PCNO initially tracks shock position better than CPGNet, but Fourier-style ripples grow and can trigger long-rollout crash; pressure mean RMSE across selected trajectories is about 2.13 and velocity errors can overflow. |

## 2026-07-04 Literature-Informed Update

The diagnostic plan now incorporates lessons from four neural-operator failure-mode papers: spectral FNO analysis, APEBench, PDE-Refiner, and Recurrent Neural Operators. The main additions are:

- Treat one-step accuracy and autoregressive stability as separate quantities in every report.
- Add correlation-time and geometric rollout aggregation so long-horizon behavior is visible even when final-step averages are noisy.
- Add graph-native scale/spectral residual diagnostics to test whether low-amplitude or high-frequency shock-local residuals drive rollout failure.
- Add an effective-CFL/receptive-field audit to compare shock-front motion against graph spacing and model propagation depth.
- Defer recurrent/unrolled control experiments until the scale/resolution and propagation diagnostics identify a concrete target.

Current blockers:

- Approximate/mesh-weighted conservation remains blocked until geometric weights are validated.
- Corrected PCNO replay is complete through the collaborator-compatible preprocessing path. Future PCNO conclusions should use that path, not the retired raw-HDF5 adapter.
- Scale/spectral residual diagnostics are pending graph-native implementation and should precede method changes.
- Recurrent/unrolled stabilization controls remain blocked until D013/D014 identify the mechanism to target.

## 2026-07-05 Interface-Latent Run Result

D017 completed on AutoDL for the selected trajectories/frames. Compact outputs are under ignored `artifacts/time_dependent_no/cpg_interface_latent_diagnostic_20260705_full/`, including `summary.json`, `per_frame_summary.csv`, `per_wave_type_summary.csv`, `sampled_edges.csv`, and `aggregate_analysis.md`.

Main evidence: decoded interface states remain density/pressure-admissible but are not physical one-sided traces; pressure boundedness between adjacent node states is near zero and owner-closer fractions are only about 0.52. The LLF/FV path is internally consistent with the model delta, but its true-update error remains nontrivial, especially around shocks. Dissipation is enriched near shocks only weakly: top-decile dissipative edges are about 17% target shock-front edges versus an 8.6% base shock-edge fraction. Frame-motion/wave-speed diagnostics are noisy and do not support a single too-fast or too-slow explanation.

## 2026-07-05 Interface-Latent Priority Update

Idea 2.2 is now the next diagnostic priority before Idea 2.1 target-ladder training. The new script should be run first on the selected hard/representative trajectories and frames for both bs2 checkpoints. Its immediate purpose is to decide whether learned `reconstruct_prims` behaves like physical one-sided traces, space-time averaged predictors, flux coordinates, hidden dissipation, or a wrong wave-speed / shock-shape mechanism.

Local implementation status:

- The exact one-off implementation was retired from the active tree during cleanup after the D017/D018 results were recorded.
- Full D017 evidence has been generated under ignored interface-latent diagnostic artifacts.

## 2026-07-05 Interface Mechanism Probe Result

D018 completed on AutoDL for the same selected trajectories/frames as D017, now in both teacher-forced and autoregressive state-source modes. Compact outputs are under ignored `artifacts/time_dependent_no/cpg_interface_mechanism_probe_20260705_full/`, including `summary.json`, `per_frame_summary.csv`, `projection_summary.csv`, `inverse_fit_summary.csv`, `report.md`, and `aggregate_analysis.md`.

Main evidence: replacing learned interface states with physical candidates or componentwise-bounded projections changes the induced model update substantially. The best physical projection (`expanded_clip`) still has update-vs-model energy relative L2 about 1.7-1.9 and learned-flux relative L2 about 7.8-7.9. Constrained inverse fits inside strict local owner-neighbor boxes almost never match learned fluxes within 10%; one-jump-expanded boxes improve the median residual but still leave relative L2 medians around 1.4-3.9 and high p90 residuals. AR-mode inputs increase learned true-update energy relative L2 from about 0.075-0.080 teacher-forced to about 0.79-0.99 on frames >0, while the internal learned update still matches the model delta at roughly 1e-6.

Interpretation: `reconstruct_prims` is not just a strangely scaled physical trace. It behaves as a functional nonphysical flux-control coordinate; projection to plausible physical states destroys the model update, and the learned flux is generally not close to a local physical LLF flux manifold. This strengthens the case for Idea 2.1 target-ladder training with explicit physical/interface/flux targets rather than supervising PCNO-FV from raw CPGNet latents.

## 2026-07-05 Corrected PCNO Preprocessed Rollout Result

After collaborator feedback, D019 uses the corrected PCNO replay path: HDF5-to-npy conversion and reconstruction before loading the Euler PCNO `.npz` contract. The active script is `scripts/time_dependent_no/rollout_pcno_preprocessed.py`; the raw-HDF5 graph adapter was retired from the active tree.

Corrected selected-rollout artifacts are under ignored `artifacts/time_dependent_no/`, including `pcno_corrected_rollout_20260705_selected/` and `pcno_corrected_animation_gallery_20260706_selected/`.

Main evidence: PCNO initially places the shock front more accurately than CPGNet, but nonphysical ripple artifacts grow over time and can trigger rollout crash. In the selected corrected replay, pressure mean RMSE is about 2.13 and final pressure RMSE about 3.48; velocity errors can reach overflow scale. The next useful diagnostics are direct ripple-energy and shock-front-position metrics, not time-lag curves.
## 2026-07-06 Active-Tree Cleanup

The tracked `time_dependent_no` surface was reduced to reusable utilities, active rollout/visualization diagnostics, corrected PCNO replay, and compact documentation. One-off inspection, smoke, state-drift, perturbation, time-alignment, raw-HDF5 PCNO adapter, and CPGNet interface-latent probe implementations were removed from the active tree after their conclusions were recorded here. Use git history for exact reproduction; do not treat retired paths as current entry points.
