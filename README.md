# NeuralOperator

<img src="docs/neural_operator.png" width="800" />

NeuralOperator is

* An educational **Neural Operator** library. 
The goal is to provide students with a light-weighted code to explore this area 
and interactive lectures with amazing [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).
* A benchmark repository originally designed to test point cloud neural operator (PCNO) and other **neural operators**. 
The goal is to provide researchers with access to various parametric partial differential equations and associated datasets, 
enabling researchers to quickly and easily develop and test novel surrogate models.

## Code Structure
* Utilities for all neural networks, such as optimizers and normalizers are in the *utility* folder.
* State-of-the-art neural operators, including `fno.py`, are in the *baselines* folder.
* The Point Cloud Neural Operator (PCNO) and its related utility files are in the *pcno* folder. If you plan to design a new neural operator, consider starting a dedicated folder similar to *pcno*.
* Datasets should be downloaded into the *data* folder. Each subfolder contains one dataset, such as `darcy_square` for the Darcy flow problem in the unit square.
* Test scripts are in the *scripts* folder. Each subfolder contains scripts for various neural operators applied to a specific dataset, with the folder name matching the corresponding dataset subfolder in the *data* folder.
